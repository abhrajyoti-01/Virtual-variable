# Virtual-variable

A C project focused on managing and simulating variables in a virtualized or abstract manner. This repository demonstrates how to handle memory manipulation in C for a specific context (e.g., embedded systems or low-level applications).

## Features
- Demonstrates virtual pointer usage for variable abstraction.
- Offers memory management techniques.
- Provides examples for easily adapting the code to different environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).
- Basic understanding of C pointer operations.
